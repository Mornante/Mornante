Intermediate Software Developer Aspiring to Become a Solutions Architect

With a diverse background that includes experience in architecting SaaS solutions for clients, I bring a unique perspective to software development. I thrive on the challenges of designing and building scalable, cloud-native applications that leverage the full capabilities of Azure.

My passion for Azure goes beyond coding‚ÄîI'm dedicated to staying at the forefront of Azure innovations, continuously honing my skills, and helping businesses unlock the full potential of the cloud.

As an enthusiastic advocate of Microsoft technologies, I specialize in integrating Azure services and other Microsoft solutions to create efficient, robust systems.

Having successfully designed and implemented SaaS solutions, I am now focusing on cutting-edge technologies, including the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance web applications.

Let‚Äôs connect to discuss the latest technology trends, exchange insights, or explore potential collaborations. I'm always open to meaningful conversations and networking opportunities. Feel free to reach out!

  üçä The Juice
</h1>

<p>
    Here you can find anything from frameworks, languages and tools that I either use on a
    daily bases or that I have used in the past.
</p>

<p>
    In my "profesional" years of software development I have gotten exposure to many different langauges and frameworks but an all time favourite of mine will always be to work with C# and .Net Framework for a back-end stack and for UI I love to work with TypeScript and Angular.

    And then just because I want to sound cool here are some technologies I would like to look into the near future.
